## Assessment

Create a simple app where users can sign up and sign in from a landing page into a simple dashboard. The landing page can be blank with only two separate links to **“Sign Up”** and **“Sign In”**.

- [x] **Sign Up [50 points]**
- [x] **User Defined Password [20 points]**
- [x] **Login [10 points]**
- [x] **User Profile [20 points]**
- [?] **Reset Password [30 points]**
  ```
  Note: Auth0 API cannot verify whether the user-entered password is correct. I believe directly utilizing Auth0's 'Forgot Password' functionality is the best solution, not only because it is easy to implement but also because it provides a higher level of security.
  ```
- [x] **Cookies and Logout [50 points]**
- [x] **User Database Dashboard [50 points]**
- [x] **User Statistics [30 points]**
  ```
  Note: Auth0 API provides daily statistical results, and real-time data is not available. Therefore, Total number of users with active sessions today will always be zero.
  ```
